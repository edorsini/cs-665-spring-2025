package patterns.adapter;

/**
 * This is the Client
 * <p>
 * Example: Use a USB cable to charge phone in a car (normally works via computer, but
 * we'd like to use it in the car)
 * <p>
 * The common patterns are:
 * 1 - Adapter - making 2 interfaces that are not compatible compatible (aka wrapper object)
 * 2 - Decorator - adds behavior without changing the  underlying object
 * 3 - Facade - taking a complex set of interactions and creating a patterns.facade instead
 * 4 - Proxy - placing an object between the client and the real object
 * <p>
 * The intention of the patterns.adapter pattern is NOT to add new behavior.  It is simply to
 * re-wire the request. Altering behavior is something else (patterns.decorator).
